Just a beginner experiment on File I/O and References.

This program just lets the user to add names into a file named STORE.txt and let them be shown in the program through its few options.

Names directly added to the file STORE.txt before program starts will also be read and will be available to display through the program.

Well its File IO and im sure im just putting in some newbie stuff in this ReadMe file exaggeratingly XD.
